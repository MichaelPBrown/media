      <p style="color:#FFF4DF;"><b>This is what got me going. Football was everything for me.<br> I started watching when I was young, I think I was around 7 years old when I really started loving the game.<br><br>
    My team that I have always followed is the Seattle Seahawks. I love everything about them, from their players to their jerseys.<br> I started playing almost immediately, playing here and there with friends.<br><br> 
Then I got to middle school. I found out there was a team, and I joined in an instant. I was out on the field for tryouts as soon as they were held. <br><br> I made it on the team, and ended up being a starter for our games
at the wide reciever and cornerback positions.<br> I was enjoying every second of it for three years straight.<br><br> Then I came to D.tech where they don't have football, however, I am still going strong practicing every day
just to walk on at college, and see where I can go from there.</b> </p>
